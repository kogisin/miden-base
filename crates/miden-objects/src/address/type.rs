/// This makes the type of the address conveniently human-readable.

/// For instance, [`AddressType::AccountId`] is chosen as 232 which is 0b1110_1000 in binary. Base32
/// encodes one character for every 5 bits and 0b11101 (= 29) translates to `a`. So, every account
/// ID address will start with `mm1a`.
